Travel Profile

1. Are you more focused on domestic or international
    e.g. Domestic, International, both

2. Do you have particular preferances and loyalties to airlines

    - Also need to measure how "strong" a preference. For example, if someone only takes United
    - Maybe a range of numbers? From preference -> diehard
    e.g. (AA, 1), (Southwest, 2)

3. Same question as above but for Hotel chains
    - chains include Hyatt, Marriott, Hiltlon

4. How much work are you willing to put into redemptions?
    - Theres a trade off between better multipliers and ease of redemptions
    - Can look on partner airlines for better deals but you have to put in work

    - e.g. "I love looking for deals", "The most work I'm going to do is browse AA.com"
