Travel Profile

1. Are you more focused on domestic or international
    e.g. Domestic, International, both

2. Do you have particular preferances and loyalties to airlines

    - Also need to measure how "strong" a preference. For example, if someone only takes United
    - Maybe a range of numbers? From preference -> diehard
    e.g. (AA, 1), (Southwest, 2)

4. How much work are you willing to put into?
    - Earning Rewards
        - Not much: I'm not sure, or I don't spend much time thinking about optimizing rewards. I will probably use one or two credit cards for most purchases.
        - Some: I  will have multiple credit cards and use them for specific purchases to get as many points as I can.
        - A lot: I will optimize every dollar I spend by strategically using my credit cards, loyalty programs and shopping portals.

    - Redeeming Rewards 
        - Not much: I'm not sure. I will likely take statement credits and won't explore other options.
        - Some: I will use my rewards for specific goalsâ€“like booking travel on an issuer portal or moving cash back into savings or investments.
        - A lot: I plan to check points valuations across transfer partners, strategically transfer my rewards, and wait on deals to maximize.
